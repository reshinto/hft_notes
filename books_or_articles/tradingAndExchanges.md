## Part I: The Structure of Trading

### 3 The Trading Industry

### 4 Orders and Order Properties
-	Orders are trade instructions that specify buy or sell terms.
-	Trading strategies are built from orders and their precise instructions.
-	Order submission strategy strongly shapes trading success and trading outcomes.
-	Markets use matching rules to pair buy and sell orders.
-	Liquidity means you can trade when you want to trade.
-	Some orders offer liquidity; other orders take liquidity by seizing it.
-	Choices to offer or take liquidity affect overall market quality.
-	Order properties depend on market type: continuous versus call markets.


**Core Ideas with Examples**

1. Orders as trade instructions
     - Plain meaning: Orders tell what to trade, buy or sell, and terms.
     - Why it matters: Clear instructions help traders get the trades they want.
     - Example A (concrete): A trader cannot negotiate, so submits a buy order.
     - Example B (contrast): Another trader specifies sell, size, timing, and price terms.
     - Signal words in the text: “Orders are trade instructions.”; “what terms.”

2. Orders build trading strategies
     - Plain meaning: Orders are the basic parts of every trading plan.
     - Why it matters: Good building blocks create strong, workable trading actions.
     - Example A (concrete): A plan uses several orders to reach a target position.
     - Example B (contrast): A vague plan with unclear orders fails to execute.
     - Signal words in the text: “fundamental building blocks of trading strategies.”

3. Importance of order submission strategy
     - Plain meaning: How and when you send orders matters a lot.
     - Why it matters: It can decide a good trade, a bad one, or none.
     - Example A (concrete): Right order at right time results in a good trade.
     - Example B (contrast): Wrong order timing leads to a costly or missed trade.
     - Signal words in the text: “most important determinant of your success.”

4. Markets match orders using rules
     - Plain meaning: Many markets pair buy and sell orders by set rules.
     - Why it matters: Knowing rules helps you use the market effectively.
     - Example A (concrete): A submitted buy order is matched when rules permit.
     - Example B (contrast): Without rule knowledge, a trader mis-times their order.
     - Signal words in the text: “set of rules to match buy and sell orders.”

5. Understanding orders reveals liquidity
     - Plain meaning: Knowing orders helps you see where liquidity comes from.
     - Why it matters: Liquidity controls whether you can trade when you choose.
     - Example A (concrete): A visible order shows a trading chance for others.
     - Example B (contrast): No suitable orders means you cannot trade now.
     - Signal words in the text: “Liquidity is the ability to trade when you want.”

6. Orders offer or take liquidity
     - Plain meaning: Some orders offer liquidity; others take liquidity quickly.
     - Why it matters: These choices change available opportunities and market quality.
     - Example A (concrete): An order presents an opportunity, so it offers liquidity.
     - Example B (contrast): Another order seizes that opportunity and takes liquidity.
     - Signal words in the text: “offer liquidity”; “take liquidity”; “affect market quality.”

7. Traders choose orders by properties
     - Plain meaning: Orders have properties that help solve trading problems.
     - Why it matters: Picking the right properties aligns with your trading goals.
     - Example A (concrete): A trader selects order properties that fit their needs.
     - Example B (contrast): Poorly chosen properties fail to solve the problem.
     - Signal words in the text: “what properties they have”; “best solve their trading problems.”

8. Market nomenclature matters
     - Plain meaning: Traders use special words to speak clearly and fast.
     - Why it matters: Shared terms prevent errors and support quick decisions.
     - Example A (concrete): A trader uses precise terms to avoid confusion.
     - Example B (contrast): Unfamiliar terms cause delays and communication mistakes.
     - Signal words in the text: “specialized words and phrases”; “market nomenclature.”

9. Same instructions, different properties by market type
     - Plain meaning: Order instructions mean the same, but properties can differ.
     - Why it matters: The market type changes how identical orders behave.
	   - Example A (concrete): In a continuous trading market, trades occur as orders arrive.
     - Example B (contrast): In call markets, all orders process at the same time.
     - Signal words in the text: “same meanings… properties differ”; “continuous trading market”; “call markets.”

10. Scope of this chapter
	    - Plain meaning: This chapter focuses on orders in continuous trading markets.
      - Why it matters: It sets the context for the properties discussed here.
      - Example A (concrete): Assumes orders arrive and trades are arranged continuously.
      - Example B (contrast): Call market details are examined in a later chapter.
      - Signal words in the text: “assume… continuous trading market”; “chapter 6.”
