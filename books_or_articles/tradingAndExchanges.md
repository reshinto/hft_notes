### 4 Orders and Order Properties
-	Orders are trade instructions that specify buy or sell terms.
-	Trading strategies are built from orders and their precise instructions.
-	Order submission strategy strongly shapes trading success and trading outcomes.
-	Markets use matching rules to pair buy and sell orders.
-	Liquidity means you can trade when you want to trade.
-	Some orders offer liquidity; other orders take liquidity by seizing it.
-	Choices to offer or take liquidity affect overall market quality.
-	Order properties depend on market type: continuous versus call markets.

**Core Ideas with Examples**

1. Orders as trade instructions
    - Orders tell what to trade, buy or sell, and terms.
    - Why it matters: Clear instructions help traders get the trades they want.
    - Example A (concrete): A trader cannot negotiate, so submits a buy order.
    - Example B (contrast): Another trader specifies sell, size, timing, and price terms.
2. Orders build trading strategies
    - Orders are the basic parts of every trading plan.
    - Why it matters: Good building blocks create strong, workable trading actions.
    - Example A (concrete): A plan uses several orders to reach a target position.
    - Example B (contrast): A vague plan with unclear orders fails to execute.
3. Importance of order submission strategy
    - How and when you send orders matters a lot.
    - Why it matters: It can decide a good trade, a bad one, or none.
    - Example A (concrete): Right order at right time results in a good trade.
    - Example B (contrast): Wrong order timing leads to a costly or missed trade.
4. Markets match orders using rules
    - Many markets pair buy and sell orders by set rules.
    - Why it matters: Knowing rules helps you use the market effectively.
    - Example A (concrete): A submitted buy order is matched when rules permit.
    - Example B (contrast): Without rule knowledge, a trader mis-times their order.
5. Understanding orders reveals liquidity
    - Knowing orders helps you see where liquidity comes from.
    - Why it matters: Liquidity controls whether you can trade when you choose.
    - Example A (concrete): A visible order shows a trading chance for others.
    - Example B (contrast): No suitable orders means you cannot trade now.
6. Orders offer or take liquidity
    - Some orders offer liquidity; others take liquidity quickly.
    - Why it matters: These choices change available opportunities and market quality.
    - Example A (concrete): An order presents an opportunity, so it offers liquidity.
    - Example B (contrast): Another order seizes that opportunity and takes liquidity.
7. Traders choose orders by properties
    - Orders have properties that help solve trading problems.
    - Why it matters: Picking the right properties aligns with your trading goals.
    - Example A (concrete): A trader selects order properties that fit their needs.
    - Example B (contrast): Poorly chosen properties fail to solve the problem.
8. Market nomenclature matters
    - Traders use special words to speak clearly and fast.
    - Why it matters: Shared terms prevent errors and support quick decisions.
    - Example A (concrete): A trader uses precise terms to avoid confusion.
    - Example B (contrast): Unfamiliar terms cause delays and communication mistakes.
9. Same instructions, different properties by market type
    - Order instructions mean the same, but properties can differ.
    - Why it matters: The market type changes how identical orders behave.
	  - Example A (concrete): In a continuous trading market, trades occur as orders arrive.
    - Example B (contrast): In call markets, all orders process at the same time.
10. Scope of this chapter
    - This chapter focuses on orders in continuous trading markets.
    - Why it matters: It sets the context for the properties discussed here.
    - Example A (concrete): Assumes orders arrive and trades are arranged continuously.
    - Example B (contrast): Call market details are examined in a later chapter.

- Strategy and timing of orders drive trading outcomes and liquidity.
- Market type changes order properties, even with the same instructions.

#### 4.1 WHAT ARE ORDERS, AND WHY DO PEOPLE USE THEM?

**Core Ideas with Examples**
1. What an order specifies
    - An order states instrument, side, size, and needed conditions.
    - Why it matters
      - Clear instructions improve chances of getting the intended trade.
    - Example A (concrete): A sell order includes a price limit and time validity.
    - Example B (contrast): A buy order allows partial fill, executed whenever possible.
2. Types of order conditions
    - Orders can set price limits, validity, timing, and partial fill rules.
    - Why it matters
      - Conditions control when and how trades are executed.
    - Example A (concrete): A trader limits acceptable price and forbids partial fills.
    - Example B (contrast): Another trader allows partial fills during the trading session.
3. Anticipating change and managing contingencies
    - Slow traders must anticipate change and write contingencies into orders.
    - Why it matters
      - Poor contingencies risk bad fills or missed opportunities.
    - Example A (concrete): An order is canceled and resubmitted as conditions change.
    - Example B (contrast): Cancellation is slow, and the old order trades undesirably.
4. Speed and competitive advantage
    - Faster response to market changes gives a strong advantage.
    - Why it matters
      - Speed improves submitting, canceling, and adjusting orders promptly.
    - Example A (concrete): Computerized traders monitor and adjust orders automatically and quickly.
    - Example B (contrast): Manual submission is slower and loses good trading chances.

**An order example**
- Harry sells only if price, time, and size conditions are satisfied.
- Why it matters
  - Combining conditions ensures the trade matches exact intentions.
- Example A (concrete): All-or-nothing requires trading the entire 7,600 shares at once.
- Example B (contrast): Day order requires execution during the current trading session.

**Mini Recap**
- Orders encode what to trade, how, and under which conditions.
- Speed and clarity matter; they change outcomes in fast markets.
- Standard orders and defined properties prevent mistakes and protect intentions.

#### 4.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS

**Core Ideas with Examples**
1. Bids, offers, and conveying willingness to trade
    - Bids and offers show willingness to buy or sell. Traders quote them directly or via orders.
    - Why it matters: Clear bids and offers help arrange trades quickly and correctly.
    - Example A (concrete): A trader quotes an offer while arranging their own trade.
    - Example B (contrast): Another trader sends an order, which conveys their bid to brokers.
2. What quotes include: prices and sizes, with common terms
    - Quotes include prices and quantities, called sizes, that traders accept.
    - Why it matters: Shared terms prevent confusion when trades are arranged under time pressure.
    - Example A (concrete): Traders say bid price and offer price to describe acceptable prices.
    - Example B (contrast): They also say asking price, bidding price, or simply bid and ask.
3. Firm prices versus soft prices; orders are usually firm
    - Firm prices can be demanded for trade. Soft prices can be revised.
    - Why it matters: Knowing firmness shows whether a quoted price is truly actionable.
    - Example A (concrete): A firm bid obligates the quoter to trade at that price.
    - Example B (contrast): A soft ask may be changed before anyone trades at it.
4. Best bid, best offer, and market quotations (BBO and NBBO)
    - The best bid is highest bid. The best offer is lowest offer.
    - Why it matters: A market quotation reports these best prices, called the BBO.
    - Example A (concrete): Many markets continuously publicize their market quotations to all traders.
    - Example B (contrast): The NBBO reports the best bid and offer in the United States.
5. The bid/ask spread, inside spread, touch, and links to liquidity
    -	The bid/ask spread is best ask minus best bid. It is the inside spread.
    -	Why it matters: A small spread, with many standing orders, usually indicates a liquid market.
    -	Example A (concrete): The English call the spread the touch in their market usage.
    -	Example B (contrast): Sports betting markets call the spread the vigorish or vig.
6. Offering liquidity: standing limit orders and Joe’s day limit bid
    - An order offers liquidity when it gives others a chance to trade.
    - Why it matters: Offering liquidity supplies trading opportunities and supports market functioning.
    - Example A (concrete): Joe bids for IBM at 100 dollars, valid only for today.
    - Example B (contrast): Joe’s order limits the price he will pay and provides liquidity.
7. “Offer” has two meanings; liquidity as a service sold by dealers
    - Offer can mean offering an item, or offering liquidity as a service.
    - Why it matters: Seeing liquidity as a service explains dealer profits from clients.
    - Example A (concrete): A trader offers shares for sale at their chosen asking price.
    - Example B (contrast): A dealer offers liquidity, earning money by filling client demands.
8. Standing orders are open offers that persist until filled or canceled
    - Standing orders are open orders that last until filled, expired, or canceled.
    - Why it matters: Outstanding orders let others trade when they choose to trade.
    - Example A (concrete): Joe’s order stands until someone sells to him, or it expires.
    - Example B (contrast): He can cancel it before close, ending the open offer to trade.
9. Demanding liquidity and seeking immediacy; Sue takes Joe’s standing order
    - Traders who want to trade quickly demand liquidity and seek immediacy.
    - Why it matters: Taking liquidity executes now by accepting someone’s standing price or quote.
    - Example A (concrete): Sue sells 100 IBM shares at 100 dollars by taking Joe’s offer.
    - Example B (contrast): Immediacy is one dimension of liquidity.
10. Trade prices and inferior prices
    - Filled order prices are trade prices. Some fills are inferior prices.
    - Why it matters: High buy fills and low sell fills are inferior outcomes.
    - Example A (concrete): A buy order that fills at a high price is inferior.
    - Example B (contrast): A sell order that fills at a low price is inferior.

**Definitions (Jargon → Simple)**

|Term|Meaning|Example|
|----|-------|-------|
|Bid|A quoted willingness to buy at a stated price|“Bid to buy shares.”|
|Offer / Ask|A quoted willingness to sell at a stated price|“Offer to sell shares.”|
|Size|The quoted quantity available to trade|“100 shares offered.”|
|Firm price|A price that others can demand to trade at|“You must trade there.”|
|Soft price|A price that can be revised before trading|“You might change it.”|
|Best bid / Best offer|Highest bid and lowest offer in the market|“Market’s top prices.”|
|BBO|Market quotation reporting best bid and best offer|“Publicized best prices.”|
|NBBO|Best bid and offer anywhere in the United States|“Nationwide best prices.”|
|Bid/ask spread|Difference between best ask and best bid|“Space between the two.”|
|Inside spread / Touch|Other names for the bid/ask spread|“English call it touch.”|
|Vigorish|Spread term in sports betting markets|“Bookie’s spread term.”|
|Offer liquidity|Provide others a chance to trade against you|“Place a standing bid.”|
|Take demand / Demand liquidity|Trade immediately by accepting a standing quote|“Hit an existing offer.”|
|Standing order / Open order|An open offer that persists until filled or canceled|“Order remains active.”|
|Immediacy|Ability to trade right now, without waiting|“Execute at once.”|
|Trade price|The actual price at which an order fills|“Executed price printed.”|
|Inferior price|Undesirable execution price relative to side|“Buy high is inferior.”|
|Agency order|Order a broker represents for a client|“Client order handled.”|
|Proprietary order|Order a trader represents for their own account|“Firm’s own trade.”|
|Pending|Order submitted to broker, awaiting acceptance|“Held for checks.”|
|Working|Accepted order, not yet filled or canceled|“Active in the market.”|

**Mini Recap**
- Bids and offers express willingness to trade, directly or through orders.
- Liquidity is offered by standing orders and demanded by traders needing immediacy.
- Spreads, quotations, and order states shape execution quality and trading speed.

#### 4.3 MARKET ORDERS
- Market orders instruct to trade at the best price now available.
- They usually fill fast, but sometimes at inferior prices.
- Impatient traders use market orders to demand liquidity with certainty.
- Execution depends on order size and current market liquidity.
- Small market orders usually fill immediately with little price effect.
- Small buys hit the best ask; small sells hit the best bid.

**Core Ideas with Examples**
1. Market order: trade now at the best available price
    - A market order tells the market to trade at today’s best price.
    - Why it matters: It gets the trade done quickly without specifying a price.
    - Example A (concrete): A market buy executes at the current best asking price.
    - Example B (contrast): A market sell executes at the current best bid price.
2. Speed versus price quality
    - Market orders usually fill fast, but price quality can suffer.
    - Why it matters: Quick fills may sometimes occur at inferior execution prices.
    - Example A (concrete): A market order completes quickly during active trading conditions.
    - Example B (contrast): The same order sometimes fills at inferior prices when conditions change.
3. Who uses market orders and why
    - Impatient traders use market orders to be sure they will trade.
    - Why it matters: They demand liquidity instead of waiting for better quoted prices.
    - Example A (concrete): A trader needs certainty now and submits a market buy order.
    - Example B (contrast): Another trader seeks certainty and sends a market sell order immediately.
4. Execution depends on size and liquidity
    - Results depend on the order’s size and available market liquidity.
    - Why it matters: Larger size or thin liquidity can lead to worse prices.
    - Example A (concrete): With ample liquidity, a small order fills with little price effect.
    - Example B (contrast): With limited liquidity, a market order may fill at inferior prices.
5. Typical behavior of small market orders
    - Small market orders usually fill immediately at the best quotes.
    - Why it matters: Small size helps avoid moving prices or missing top-of-book quotes.
    - Example A (concrete): A small market buy trades at the best, lowest asking price.
    - Example B (contrast): A small market sell trades at the best, highest bid price.
6. Market Order Example: APWR quotes and Bill’s execution
    - Quotes show prices and sizes; Bill’s small buy hits the best ask.
    - Why it matters: The example shows immediate fill at the publicized best price.
    - Example A (concrete): Dealers bid 36.80 for 500 shares and offer 36.85 for 400.
    - Example B (contrast): Bill buys 200 shares at 36.85, matching the best ask size.

**Definitions (Jargon → Simple)**

|Term|Meaning|Example|
|----|-------|-------|
|Market order|Instruction to trade now at the best available price|“Buy now at current best.”|
|Best ask|The lowest asking price available right now|“36.85 shown to sell.”|
|Best bid|The highest bid price available right now|“36.80 shown to buy.”|
|Liquidity|How much you can trade without moving the price|“Enough size at quotes.”|
|Inferior price|A worse execution price for your side|“Buy fills too high.”|
|Size|The quantity available at a quoted price|“Offer good for 400.”|
|Quote|A displayed bid or ask with a price and size|“Bid 36.80 for 500.”|

**Mini Recap**
- Market orders trade now at the best available quoted price.
- Speed is high, but inferior prices can occur with limited liquidity.
- Small orders typically fill immediately at the best bid or best ask.

**4.3.1 Market Orders Pay the Spread**
- Market order traders pay the bid/ask spread through their executions.
- A quick round-trip shows the total cost equals the whole spread.
- Per trade, the transaction cost equals half of the spread.
- The spread is the price of immediacy for market orders.
- With no extra information, midpoint value is the best value estimate.
- Paying above midpoint to buy is liquidity cost for immediacy.
- Selling below midpoint also pays liquidity cost for immediacy.

**Core Ideas with Examples**
1. Market order traders pay the bid/ask spread
    - Market orders trade now and pay the bid/ask spread cost.
    - Why it matters: Using immediacy has a direct, quantifiable execution cost.
    - Example A (concrete): Amy buys at 102 when the best offer is 102.
    - Example B (contrast): She later sells at 100 when the best bid is 100.
2. Round-trip example reveals the full spread cost
    - A buy then sell at unchanged quotes loses the entire spread.
    - Why it matters: The simple sequence shows how spread costs accumulate.
    - Example A (concrete): Buy 102 with best bid 100 and best offer 102.
    - Example B (contrast): Sell 100 assuming the best bid did not change afterward.
3. Per-trade cost equals half of the spread
    - Two trades split the spread, so each trade costs half.
    - Why it matters: Traders can plan costs per execution, excluding commissions.
    - Example A (concrete): Amy’s two trades lose the spread; each trade loses half.
    - Example B (contrast): Text notes “transaction cost per trade… exclusive of commissions.”
4. Spread is the price of immediacy for market orders
    - Immediacy has a price; for market orders, it is half-spread.
    - Why it matters: Traders pay for certainty to trade right now.
    - Example A (concrete): Buying now at 102 pays 1 above estimated value.
    - Example B (contrast): Selling now at 100 gives 1 below estimated value.
5. Midpoint as best estimate when trader is uninformed
    - With no extra information, value equals the average of quotes.
    - Why it matters: The midpoint value explains the measured liquidity cost.
    - Example A (concrete): Quotes 100 and 102 imply midpoint value of 101.
    - Example B (contrast): Amy is uninformed; erratic behavior supports that assumption.
6. Buy above midpoint and sell below midpoint each pay half-spread
    - Paying above, or receiving below, midpoint equals half-spread cost.
    - Why it matters: It shows symmetric liquidity costs for buys and sells.
    - Example A (concrete): Amy paid 102 for a bond worth 101; cost is 1.
    - Example B (contrast): She received 100 for a bond worth 101; cost is 1.

**Definitions (Jargon → Simple)**

|Term|Meaning|Example|
|----|-------|-------|
|Market order|Instruction to trade now at the best available price|“Buy now at 102.”|
|Bid/ask spread|Difference between best ask and best bid|“102 minus 100 equals 2.”|
|Best bid|Highest price a buyer is currently willing to pay|“Best bid is 100.”|
|Best offer / Best ask|Lowest price a seller is currently willing to accept|“Best offer is 102.”|
|Round-trip|A buy followed by a sell of the same instrument|“Buy then sell quickly.”|
|Immediacy|Ability to trade immediately without waiting|“Trade right now.”|
|Midpoint value|Average of best bid and best offer|“(100 + 102) / 2 = 101.”|
|Uninformed trader|Trader with no extra information about value|“Behavior appears erratic.”|
|Liquidity cost|Execution loss paid to trade immediately|“Pay 1 above midpoint.”|

**Mini Recap**
- Market orders trade now and pay for immediacy through the spread.
- The round-trip shows full spread loss; each side costs half.
- Midpoint explains why buys and sells each pay symmetric liquidity costs.

**4.3.2 Price Improvement**
- Market orders can trade better than current bid and offer in negotiated markets.
- Such better fills are called price improvement in the text.
- A trader steps in front to offer a better price to you.
- Price improvement often occurs when the spread is wide and orders small.
- Price improvement lowers the cost of liquidity for incoming market orders.
- Specialists may improve price due to exchange regulations on public quotes.

**Core Ideas with Examples**
1. Price improvement in negotiated markets
    - In negotiated markets, market orders may beat the posted prices.
    - Why it matters: You might receive a better execution than the displayed quote.
    - Example A (concrete): A market order trades better than the current best bid or offer.
    - Example B (contrast): Without negotiation, it trades exactly at the posted best price.
2. How improvement happens: stepping in front
    - A trader steps in front and quotes a better price to you.
    - Why it matters: Stepping in front delivers an execution better than current quotes.
    - Example A (concrete): Someone bids above the best bid to buy your small sell.
    - Example B (contrast): Without stepping in front, your sell hits the standing best bid.
3. When improvement is likely: wide spread and small order
    - Price improvement often appears when the spread is wide and size small.
    - Why it matters: Wide room and small risk make improving more attractive to traders.
    - Example A (concrete): A small market order arrives when quotes are far apart.
    - Example B (contrast): A large incoming order or narrow spread sees less improvement.
4. Price improvement lowers liquidity cost
    - Better execution reduces the cost of liquidity you must pay.
    - Why it matters: You keep more value when trading immediately with an improved price.
    - Example A (concrete): Your sell gets improved above the posted bid, reducing your loss.
    - Example B (contrast): Without improvement, your sell trades at the lower posted bid.

**Definitions (Jargon → Simple)**

|Term|Meaning|Example|
|----|-------|-------|
|Market order|Trade now at the best price currently available|“Sell immediately at the market.”|
|Price improvement|Execution better than the current best bid or offer|“Sell above the posted bid.”|
|Step in front|Quote a better price than the current best price|“Bid higher than 23.35.”|
|Spread|Difference between the bid and the offer|“23.45 minus 23.35.”|
|Liquidity|Ability to trade when you want to trade|“Execute quickly today.”|
|Cost of liquidity|Value you give up to trade immediately|“Less loss with improvement.”|
|Specialist|Dealer on the floor trading for own account|“Fills small orders on exchange.”|
|Exchange regulations|Rules that limit specialist behavior versus public traders|“Cannot buy at public bid.”|
|Public traders|Non-specialists quoting the market’s public prices|“Buyers at 23.35.”|

**Mini Recap**
- Price improvement means trading better than the current displayed prices.
- It often appears with wide spreads and small incoming market orders.
- Specialists may improve due to regulations, lowering liquidity costs for you.

**4.3.3 Market Impact**
- Large market orders are harder to execute than small ones.
- Counterparties fear trading against possibly well-informed large traders.
- To attract trades, large buyers bid up; large sellers offer down.
- These price concessions create market impact that grows with order size.
- For large orders, impact is usually the biggest trading cost.
- Impact depends on liquidity; illiquid markets move more on small orders.
- Large orders may pay more than half the spread for liquidity.

**Core Ideas with Examples**

1. Large orders are harder to execute
    - Big trades need willing counterparties, which are hard to find.
    - Why it matters: Scarcity of counterparts delays fills and worsens execution prices.
    - Example A (concrete): Traders may not be interested in the specific instrument.
    - Example B (contrast): Traders may fear the other side is well informed.
2. Fear of informed trading reduces willingness to trade
    - Others avoid trading if they suspect you know more.
    - Why it matters: Suspicion reduces supply of counterparties for large trades.
    - Example A (concrete): They are afraid to trade with a possibly informed trader.
    - Example B (contrast): Without that fear, more traders might take the other side.
3. Price concessions and market impact
    - Large buyers raise bids; large sellers lower offers to attract trades.
    - Why it matters: These changes move prices and create market impact costs.
    - Example A (concrete): A large buyer bids prices up to encourage selling.
    - Example B (contrast): A large seller offers prices down to encourage buying.
4. Impact increases with size and dominates large-order costs
    - Bigger orders move prices more and cost more to complete.
    - Why it matters: For big orders, impact is usually the most significant cost.
    - Example A (concrete): Traders who submit large market orders pay heavy impact.
    - Example B (contrast): They often pay more than half the spread for liquidity.
5. Impact depends on market liquidity
    - Illiquid markets move on small orders; liquid markets absorb size.
    - Why it matters: Liquidity conditions determine feasibility and price movement.
    - Example A (concrete): In small, illiquid markets, even small orders move prices.
    - Example B (contrast): In large, liquid markets, million-dollar orders may barely move prices.
